### This is just a small project for learning and testing new things.
Here's a list of what I want to learn with this:
- Angular. Have a basic understanding of how Angular works and how things are done. Have some experience with React but since I need to learn Angular for work, this will help.
- Spring Microservices. I've only ever worked on projects that were monoliths so this should help get a basic understanding of how things work when services are split up and what challenges arise with this architecture.
- gRPC. I've heard and seen that gRPC is typically used for service to service interactions due to its higher speed and lower memory usage from how it transmits data as binaries instead of JSON or XML for example. Serialization is supposedly handled by gRPC.
- GraphQL. REST APIs are very popular and I've developed and worked with a few myself, but GraphQL is something I've been wanting to learn and give a try for a while now. It seems to offer a better frontend experience at the cost of potentially more complex backend.

### Here's the basic concept
Since this is just a basic learning example I simply want to create a basic frontend with some "products". A user, who's just going to be hardcoded and automatically signed in, can view products and add/remove them from their cart. Simple premise, but since this is my first time doing microservices, gRPC and GraphQL the complexity will be on the backend and that's where most of the learning will be happening. No fancy styling or responsive design, that's not the point of this project.

This project is just a stepping stone to get into a more complex microservices + graphql + grpc project I plan to work on next.
